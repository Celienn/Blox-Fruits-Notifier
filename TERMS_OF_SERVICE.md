# Terms of Service

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the bot Blox Fruit Notifier. By using this Bot, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you should not use the Bot.

### 2. Description of Service

The Bot provides notifications on Discord when specific devil fruits are available for purchase in the roblox game "[Blox Fruits](https://www.roblox.com/games/2753915549/Blox-Fruits)." Users can configure the Bot to notify them about selected fruits and check the current stock. The notifications can be toggled on and off by using a command.
The current fruit stock can be shown in a channel in real time ( by having the bot looking on the fandom wiki of the game).

### 3. User Responsibilities

By using the Bot, you agree to:

Use the Bot in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service.

Not abuse, exploit, or attempt to disrupt the Bot’s functionality.

Accept that notifications may not always be accurate due to data being retrieved from a third-party [wiki](https://blox-fruits.fandom.com/wiki/Blox_Fruits_%22Stock%22).

### 4. Limitation of Liability

The Bot is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee the accuracy of stock notifications and are not responsible for any missed or incorrect alerts.

### 5. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
